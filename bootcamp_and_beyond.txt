1) Before the boot camp, I worked as an IT Project Coordinator, Data Analyst, and an software QA Analyst.  I went through Per Scholas A+ & software QA boot camps.  I also earned Comptia Net+ & Sec+. I am currently a Certified Scrum Master.  My most recent learning adventure was with Java.

2) I chose a boot camp because it is much quicker than attending college.  Additionally, I was reluctant because my 2 college degrees have only led to debt.  It was not feasible for me to spend years in school at this stage in my life.  So, here I am.

3) I think this boot camp will be difficult, but much easier than the last one.  This is because I now have study aids in place to facilitate my learning, despite having a learning disorder.

4) I chose Max because it was the only local dev boot camp approved for VA Vocational Rehabilitation funding.
